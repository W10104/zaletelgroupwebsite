I am interested in various aspects of quantum phases of matter with strong electronic correlations. While I work on developing appropriate theoretical descriptions of such states, I work in close connection with experiments on real materials. My recent research focus includes strong-coupling superconductivity (eg: in magic angle graphene), topologically ordered phases like quantum spin liquids, and quantum sensing of correlated matter using impurity qubits.
