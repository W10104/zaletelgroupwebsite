I'm a grad student working on moir√© materials, namely TMD heterostructures and magic angle twisted bilayer graphene. Prior to joining the Zaletel group, I did my undergrad in my hometown, Toronto, Canada. When I'm not running DMRG calculations, I enjoy making and recording music, and have recently focused my efforts on guitar.
