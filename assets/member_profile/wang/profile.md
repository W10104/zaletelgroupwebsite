I grew up in Xi'an, China, and received my bachelor's degree in physics from Peking University. I am interested in various topological phases in condensed matter systems, which embody both the elegance of mathematical structure and the hidden diversity of physics at the quantum scale. My recent work has focused on the novel phases in twisted bilayer graphene and similarly-constructed van der Waals heterostructures.
